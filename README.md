# Background
        I've just joined Pymaceuticals, Inc., a new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer medications. 
        Recently, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.
        As a senior data analyst at the company, I've been given access to the complete data from their most recent animal study. In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.
        The executive team has tasked me with generating all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the clinical study.
        They have also asked me for a top-level summary of the study results.

                Observation Analysis:

                        Mouse Population:
                                -Capomulin had the largest number of mice (230), while Zoniferol had the fewest (182).
                                -After removing duplicates, the total number of mice was 248, with an equal distribution of 124 females and 125 males.
                        
                        Tumor Volume Correlation:
                                -A strong positive correlation (0.84) was observed between mouse weight and average tumor volume. This indicates that as mouse weight increases, so does the average tumor volume.
                        
                        Regression Analysis:
                                -Regression analysis was used to model the relationship between mouse weight and average tumor volume.
                                -The R-squared value of 0.70 suggests that the model explains 70% of the variation in tumor volume, indicating a fairly good fit to the data.
                        
                        Treatment Efficacy:
                                -Among the selected treatments, Capomulin and Ramicane demonstrated superior efficacy in reducing tumor size.
