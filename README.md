        **Internet Search: I utilized Google Search and slack overflow to research coding concepts, algorithms, and best practices.
        **Gemini AI: I leveraged Gemini AI to generate code suggestions, debug errors, and provide explanations for complex code segments.
        **Support Staff: I recieved help from my instructor and class TA during office hours for help with debugging errors and further explanation for complex code segments.
        **Please note: While these tools were invaluable in my development process, the final code is the result of my analysis, testing, and refinement.
